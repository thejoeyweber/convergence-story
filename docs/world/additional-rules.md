# Additional Rules

## System Name
- [Currently, there are rumblings about specialized disciplines that do not fit neatly under standard magic or advanced technology. Examples might include alchemy, psionics, or biologically-based enhancements. These have been historically overlooked or under-documented in each timeline.]

## Known Practitioners
- [Practitioners remain rare or secretive. In the magic-centric realm, certain fringe wizard orders or druidic circles may keep archaic knowledge. In the tech-centric realm, biotech labs or cybernetic enclaves might be experimenting. The real-world timeline largely dismisses these or treats them as myths.]

## Special Constraints or Costs
- [These systems often carry unique resource demands (rare reagents, exotic energies, or moral trade-offs). Energy depletion, mental strain, or ecological impact can be more pronounced than standard magic/tech usage.]

## Notable Artifacts / Materials
- [Occasional references to “forgotten relics” or “lost experiments” that neither strictly classify as magic items nor standard advanced tech. They may appear in all three timelines, recognized differently (a philosopher’s stone in one world, a quantum anomaly in another).]
