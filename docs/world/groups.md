# Groups / Factions

## Faction One
- **Overview**: 
  - A coalition of mages or advanced researchers who suspect there are parallel realities. In Arcania, they might be a council of archmagi exploring rumored “plane overlaps.” In Technia, they are a research consortium analyzing anomalies in cosmic data. 
- **Leadership**: 
  - A rotating council of experts (e.g., a high-level mage, a space physicist, or even a real-world underground scholar).
- **Allies & Enemies**: 
  - Allies: Some academic institutions, forward-thinking leaders.  
  - Enemies: Traditionalists or those who fear the destabilizing effect of discovering parallel worlds.
- **Symbols or Emblems**: 
  - A stylized eye superimposed on an abstract representation of three branching paths (symbolizing the three timelines).
- **Current Goals**: 
  - Confirm the existence of parallel realities, gather knowledge, possibly orchestrate or prevent an eventual Convergence.

## Faction Two
- **Overview**: 
  - A militant or protective order that strives to regulate or restrict the use of potent powers (be it magic, advanced weapons, or covert real-world tech). 
- **Leadership**: 
  - A strict hierarchy led by a grandmaster figure—someone convinced that unbridled “otherworldly” power threatens stability. 
- **Allies & Enemies**: 
  - Allies: Some government bodies in each timeline, fearful of catastrophic abuses.  
  - Enemies: Any group pushing the boundaries of magic or tech recklessly. 
- **Symbols or Emblems**: 
  - A shield encircled by a ring of stylized runes or circuitry. 
- **Current Goals**: 
  - Suppress or control key resources (mana wells, advanced reactors), enact strict regulations on necromancy or AI, and quell uprisings related to “forbidden knowledge.”
