# Magic Rules

## Sources of Magic
- **Arcane**: Derived from ambient mana or ley lines. Studied academically by wizards, sorcerers, etc.
- **Divine**: Channeled from deities or cosmic entities. Clerics and paladins rely on faith-based pacts.
- **Fey / Natural**: Tied to nature spirits, Faerealm energies, or primal forces. Druids, rangers, or fey-touched.
- **Pact / Other**: Agreements with powerful extraplanar beings. Warlocks or similar become conduits for alien or eldritch power.

## Limitations
- **Energy & Exhaustion**: Spellcasters expend personal or ambient energy. Overuse causes burnout or damage to ley lines.
- **Ritual & Complexity**: Higher-tier spells require elaborate components, circles, or incantations. Quick casting drains resources fast.
- **Ethical / Moral Constraints**: Societal or council-imposed bans on necromancy, mind-control, destructive conjurations, etc.

## Common Spells or Techniques
- **Utility Cantrips**: Simple illusions, lighting, minor telekinesis. Widely taught in more urban areas.
- **Battle Magics**: Firebolts, shield charms. Common in militarized kingdoms or guilds.
- **Healing & Buffs**: Clerical blessings, druidic regeneration. Vital in wars and public health.

## Rare or Forbidden Powers
- **High Necromancy**: Large-scale undead armies or soulbinding spells. Outlawed by major councils.
- **Reality-Bending Rituals**: Epic-level incantations that warp environments or risk planar tears.
- **Dark Pacts**: Deals with malevolent entities for immense power, typically leading to corruption or exile.
