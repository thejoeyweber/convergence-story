# Magic Rules

## Sources of Magic
- [Rooted in a universal force that also underlies alien technology, though expressed differently in the Fantasy Timeline.]
- [Primarily associated with the Fey Realm in the Fantasy Timeline, with potential minor or forgotten influence in the Real and Sci-Fi Timelines.]

## Limitations
- [No concrete rules set yet. Magic might require material components, training, or pacts with fey or other cosmic entities.]
- [In the Real Timeline, full-fledged magic is effectively unheard of, though rumored anomalies exist.]

## Common Spells or Techniques
- [Not yet defined. Could include typical D&D-like cantrips, illusions, or elemental manipulations in the Fantasy Timeline.]

## Rare or Forbidden Powers
- [Details have not been specified. Possibly advanced dimensional travel or major reality-warping spells that connect different timelines, but these remain theoretical so far.]
