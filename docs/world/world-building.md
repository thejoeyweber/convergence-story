# World Building

## Overview
This universe comprises **three parallel timelines**:
1. **Fantasy Timeline**: Magic-dominant world with multiple sapient races (humans, elves, dwarves, others) and ongoing mystical developments.  
2. **Sci-Fi Timeline**: A multi-planetary civilization advanced in AI, spaceflight, and possible alliances with alien species—though not fully integrated.  
3. **Real Timeline**: Mirrors our real Earth’s near-future technology, with no openly confirmed magic or alien presence.

They share an origin but diverged in ancient times due to a forgotten **Divergence** event. Each timeline evolves under different forces—magic vs. technology vs. mundane—and experiences “echoes” or subtle overlaps hinting at the existence of parallel worlds.

## The Divergence
- An ancient, nearly mythic occurrence happening around what we’d call the early Mesopotamian era.
- Pre-Divergence, primal forms of magic, tech, and divine/extraterrestrial interaction coexisted on a rudimentary scale.
- A cosmological alignment triggered the split into three distinct timelines; details are largely lost, with only obscure myths or contradictory legends suggesting what truly happened.
- Whether it was accidental or influenced by powerful beings is unclear; stories persist of individuals who sensed the coming split and attempted (successfully or not) to steer its outcome.

## Timeline of Major Events (Broad Ages)
*(Exact dates remain fluid. Only general milestones are noted.)*

1. **Pre-Divergence**  
   - Early hunter-gatherer societies, primal magic/tech seeds, direct deity interactions.  

2. **Post-Divergence—Foundational Eras**  
   - Fantasy: Gradual rise of arcane guilds and nature-focused cultures.  
   - Sci-Fi: Proto-scientific societies, possibly influenced by alien artifacts.  
   - Real: Stone-Bronze transitions, mythic beliefs, no recorded proof of magic or alien contact.

3. **Medieval / Early Empires**  
   - Each timeline develops distinctly, shaped by either mana, high-tech leaps, or standard human progress.

4. **Renaissance & Industrial Ages (Varies per Timeline)**  
   - Fantasy: Magical renaissance, forging of powerful artifacts.  
   - Sci-Fi: Early spaceflight, mechanical breakthroughs.  
   - Real: Global navigation, steam power, eventual modernity.

5. **Modern & Near-Future**  
   - Fantasy: Large-scale magical conflicts, stabilized treaties, refined magi-tech.  
   - Sci-Fi: Interplanetary expansions, advanced AI, tension between corporate and governmental structures.  
   - Real: Digital revolution, climate challenges, fringe labs studying anomalies.

## Approaching Full Convergence
- Convergence is not instantaneous but a **gradual bleed** between timelines. Strange phenomena—portal-like rifts, overlapping memories—will increase before a full unification.
- How long this process takes, or if it can be halted, is unknown. Some factions strive to hasten it, others to prevent it.

## Key Themes
- **Magic vs. Technology vs. Mundane**: Three paths to solving fundamental problems, each with its own triumphs and flaws.
- **Resource Competition**: Mana wells, rare alien materials, or terrestrial fossil fuels—parallel reflections of scarcity and exploitation.
- **Ethical Debates**: Parallels between necromancy or mind-control and advanced AI or genetic engineering.
- **Shared Human Condition**: All timelines grapple with societal inequities, major conflicts, and curiosity that pushes boundaries.

## Overall Canonical Facts
- **Parallel Timelines**: Each timeline is a branch from a common origin.  
- **Near-Convergences**: Historical events that nearly reunited the timelines, leaving behind relics and myths in each.  
- **Hidden Crossovers**: Rumors in each timeline of unexplained artifacts, cosmic energies, or supernatural phenomena.  
- **Full Convergence**: A potential unification now looming, with unpredictable consequences.
