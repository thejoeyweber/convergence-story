# World Building

## Overview
This universe comprises **three parallel timelines**:
1. **Arcania (Fantasy)**: Magic-dominant world with multiple sapient races (humans, elves, dwarves, others) and ongoing contact with the Faerealm.
2. **Technia (Sci-Fi)**: A multi-planetary civilization advanced in AI, spaceflight, and interstellar relations with alien species—though not fully integrated.
3. **Real (Mundane)**: Mirrors our real Earth’s historical progress, near-future technology, and no openly confirmed magic or alien presence.

Each timeline evolves under different driving forces—**magic** vs. **technology** vs. **mundane**—yet they share underlying universal laws. Across history, they’ve experienced “near-convergence” events that echo major real-world developments but never fully merged.

## Timeline of Major Events
*(Dates are approximate and differ per timeline. Below are broad ages rather than strict years.)*

1. **Prehistoric / Early Civilization**  
   - Fantasy: Emergence of druids, shamanic magic.  
   - Sci-Fi: Forgotten alien artifacts influencing early engineering.  
   - Real: Basic stone-to-bronze transitions, mythic beliefs, no proven magic/alien tech.

2. **Classical / Medieval Eras**  
   - Fantasy: Formation of arcane guilds, city-states vying for mana resources.  
   - Sci-Fi: Proto-scientific societies, half-legend alien contact references.  
   - Real: Empires (Rome, Persia, etc.), universal religions, strictly natural progress.

3. **Renaissance & Exploration**  
   - Fantasy: Magical renaissance, rediscovery of ancient grimoires.  
   - Sci-Fi: Mechanical breakthroughs, first systematic cosmic observations.  
   - Real: Global navigation, printing press, scientific revolution seeds.

4. **Industrial & Colonial Period**  
   - Fantasy: Industrial magic, mage-run expansions into new territories.  
   - Sci-Fi: Rapid industrial leaps, early spaceflight. Corporate/political rivalries.  
   - Real: Steam power, colonial empires, first global conflicts.

5. **Modern / 20th Century & Beyond**  
   - Fantasy: Large-scale magical wars, treaties limiting destructive spells, advanced magi-tech integration.  
   - Sci-Fi: Interplanetary expansions, advanced AI, alien alliances, potential for large conflicts.  
   - Real: Two world wars, digital revolution, near-future transformations.

6. **Near-Future / Pre-Convergence**  
   - Each realm stands on the brink of new frontiers, noticing anomalies or “echoes” hinting that other timelines exist but remain unconfirmed.

## Key Themes
- **Magic vs. Technology vs. Mundane**: Three distinct evolutions reflecting different solutions to universal challenges.  
- **Resource Competition**: Mana wells, rare alien materials, or terrestrial fossil fuels.  
- **Ethical Debates**: Necromancy and mind-control parallels advanced AI ethics or genetic engineering dilemmas.  
- **Shared Human Condition**: Despite differences, all timelines face social inequalities, major conflicts, and unstoppable curiosity.

## Overall Canonical Facts
- **Parallel Timelines**: They share the same cosmic “meta-laws” but diverged historically.  
- **Near-Convergences**: Occur at pivotal developments (e.g., pyramid-building, industrial leaps) but never fully unify.  
- **Hidden Crossovers**: Real timeline has cryptic UFO or occult rumors. Arcania has ancient alien relics missed or buried. Technia can have minor unexplained “arcane-like” phenomena.  
- **Approaching Convergence**: The final storyline sees a drawn-out merging, unveiling each timeline’s illusions, forging new possibilities—and conflicts.
