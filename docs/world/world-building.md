# World Building

## Overview
This setting encompasses three parallel timelines—Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Real—each shaped by different forces (magic, alien tech, or purely human innovation). They share certain "near-convergence" events, such as the building of the pyramids, which appear in each timeline. Over time, these worlds begin to merge in a drawn-out convergence process, sparking both conflict and cooperation.

## Timeline of Major Events
- **Year 0**: [No official starting date. Possibly marks ancient divergences triggered by rediscovery of magic or alien tech or remains normal in the Real Timeline.]
- **Year 500**: [Unspecified events. Could reflect parallel arcs or “rhyming” historical conflicts (e.g., magical wars, interplanetary skirmishes, or real-world medieval strife).]
- **Year 800**: [Also open-ended. Possibly a major near-convergence or the birth of secret factions aware of other timelines.]

## Key Themes
- **Convergence & Overlap**: Shared events and places where timelines intertwine, challenging each timeline’s understanding of reality.
- **Magic vs. Technology vs. Human Ingenuity**: Different forms of power reach an equivalent scale, though each follows distinct rules.
- **Secrecy & Revelation**: Small groups in each timeline gain partial knowledge of the others, fueling covert plans and eventual open conflict or alliance.

## Overall Canonical Facts
- The Fey Realm exists as a single plane accessible from any timeline, though primarily active in the Fantasy Timeline.
- Alien influences shape the Sci-Fi world; the Real Timeline remains largely unaware or dismissive of them.
- Each timeline’s historical arcs loosely mirror each other, reflecting universal patterns of exploration, conflict, and discovery.
- The final convergence is a drawn-out process, with no guaranteed apocalyptic or utopian end.
