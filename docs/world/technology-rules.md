# Technology Rules

## Technology Level
- [Varies across the three timelines: advanced interstellar in the Sci-Fi Timeline, near-future or modern in the Real Timeline, and primarily pre-industrial in the Fantasy Timeline but influenced by magic.]

## Key Innovations
- [In the Sci-Fi Timeline, alien-derived tech shapes spacecraft and possibly biotech or terraforming.]
- [Real Timeline relies on purely human advances in engineering, digital networks, and global logistics.]
- [Fantasy Timeline's technological progress is overshadowed by magic, though basic inventions exist.]

## Societal Impact
- [In the Sci-Fi Timeline, entire cultures revolve around alien trade or interplanetary travel.]
- [In the Real Timeline, technology fosters global communication and hidden conspiracies around near-convergence events.]
- [In the Fantasy Timeline, minimal formal tech adoption, but magical items may play a parallel role.]

## Notable Devices or Systems
- [No specific devices have been named. Future expansions may introduce iconic alien ships, magical-mechanical hybrids, or advanced Real Timeline AI systems that detect timeline anomalies.]
