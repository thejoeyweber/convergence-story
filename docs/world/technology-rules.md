# Technology Rules

## Technology Level
- **Pre-Convergence**:
  - **Arcania**: Limited mechanical engineering, overshadowed by magic (some early magi-tech).  
  - **Technia**: Futuristic, multi-planetary society with FTL travel, advanced AI, genetic engineering, and robust industrial infrastructure.  
  - **Real Timeline**: Contemporary Earth (near-future), advanced digital networks, early private space travel, no widely accepted magic or alien contact.

## Key Innovations
- **FTL / Warp (Technia)**: Allows interplanetary or interstellar expansion.  
- **AI & Robotics (Technia)**: Sophisticated androids, partial sentient intelligence.  
- **Magi-Tech (Arcania)**: Items infused with mana, e.g., crystal-powered lighting or elemental-based machinery.  
- **Subtle Real-World Tech**: Real Earth sees advanced biotech, quantum computing, but no open “wonders” of magic or alien craft.

## Societal Impact
- **Technia**:
  - Automation drives economic shift, social stratification between enhanced and baseline humans, corporates vs. governments.  
  - Interstellar trade and minimal but growing alien alliances.
- **Arcania**:
  - Magical academies and guilds shape education, politics, and labor.  
  - Ecological or ethical concerns around large-scale spell usage.
- **Real**:
  - Modern or near-future societies deeply connected digitally, grappling with climate, AI ethics, and hidden “paranormal” leaks.

## Notable Devices or Systems
- **Off-World Mining Stations (Technia)**: Resource extraction hubs with partial synthetic workforce.  
- **Enchanted Infrastructure (Arcania)**: Mana-fueled teleporter gates, city-wide wards, or floating towers.  
- **Secret Real-World Labs**: Fringe research facilities rumored to handle unexplained phenomena (UFOs, alleged “occult” relics).
