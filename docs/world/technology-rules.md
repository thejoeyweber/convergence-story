# Technology Rules

## Technology Level
- **Pre-Convergence**:
  - **Fantasy Timeline**: Limited mechanical engineering, overshadowed by magic (some early magi-tech).  
  - **Sci-Fi Timeline**: Futuristic, multi-planetary society with faster-than-light travel, advanced AI, genetic engineering, and robust industrial infrastructure.  
  - **Real Timeline**: Contemporary Earth (near-future), advanced digital networks, early private space travel, no widely accepted magic or alien contact.

## Key Innovations
- **FTL / Warp (Sci-Fi)**: Enables interplanetary or interstellar expansion.  
- **AI & Robotics (Sci-Fi)**: Sophisticated androids, partially sentient intelligence.  
- **Magi-Tech (Fantasy)**: Items infused with mana (e.g., crystal-powered lighting or elemental-based machinery).  
- **Real-World Tech (Real)**: Advanced biotech, quantum computing, high-speed communication networks—though not recognized as “magic.”

## Societal Impact
- **Sci-Fi Timeline**:
  - Automation drives economic shifts, social stratification between enhanced and baseline humans, and tensions between corporate and governmental powers.  
  - Interstellar trade and minimal but growing alien alliances.
- **Fantasy Timeline**:
  - Magical academies and guilds shape education, politics, and labor.  
  - Ecological or ethical concerns around large-scale spell usage.
- **Real Timeline**:
  - Modern or near-future societies deeply connected digitally, grappling with climate change, AI ethics, and hidden “paranormal” phenomena.

## From the Outside Looking In
- **Fantasy POV**: 
  - The Real Timeline’s mechanical engineering, firearms, and advanced electronics seem extraordinarily efficient—even if they lack overt “mana.”  
  - The scale of global communications (internet, satellites) could appear as a non-magical version of scrying on a mass scale.
- **Sci-Fi POV**: 
  - The Real Timeline’s ingenuity with limited resources might be surprising—especially in fields like medical research, satellite tech, or nuclear energy.  
  - Though less advanced overall than the sci-fi timeline, certain real-world breakthroughs in computing or biotech might still garner respect.

## Notable Devices or Systems
- **Off-World Mining Stations (Sci-Fi)**: Resource extraction hubs with a partially synthetic workforce.  
- **Enchanted Infrastructure (Fantasy)**: Mana-fueled teleporter gates, city-wide wards, or floating towers.  
- **Secret Real-World Labs**: Fringe research facilities rumored to handle unexplained phenomena (UFOs, alleged “occult” relics).
